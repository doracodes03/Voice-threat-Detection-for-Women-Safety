# 🚨 Real-Time Multilingual Threat Detection - AI-Powered Voice & Text Analysis for Women's Safety

## 🔥 Project Overview

Every second counts during an emergency — yet traditional safety apps rely heavily on **manual triggers**, **single-language** support, and **delayed responses**.

**This project changes that reality.**

We present **the world's first hybrid AI model** capable of **detecting distress signals in real-time** from **both voice and text inputs** — across **English**, **Hindi**, and **Bengali** — specifically tailored for **women’s safety**.  
Unlike generic abuse detection tools, our system is **designed for real-world danger moments** — offering **instant multilingual threat classification**, **wearable integration**, and **automated emergency escalation**.

## 🛡️ What Makes This Project Unique?

- 🗣 **Dual-Modality Intelligence**: Handles **voice** and **text** inputs simultaneously.
- 🌐 **Multilingual Power**: Supports **code-mixed Hindi-English-Bengali** seamlessly (MuRIL embeddings).
- ⚡ **Ultra-Fast Real-Time Detection**: Optimized for **low-latency** wearable and mobile environments.
- 🤖 **Hybrid AI Architecture**: Combines **FastText**, **MuRIL**, **BiLSTM**, and **SMOTE** for maximum accuracy with minimum compute.
- 🔥 **Emergency Sensitivity**: Recognizes rare but critical cases like **rape threats** and **SOS emergencies** — where traditional systems fail.
- 🛠 **IoT + Mobile Ready**: Designed to embed easily into **smartwatches**, **IoT devices**, and **mobile apps**.
- 🧠 **Contextual Understanding**: Distinguishes between casual talk and genuine distress with **high precision** (96.65% accuracy).

**No other public project today offers this combination of real-time, multilingual, voice-text threat detection built for instant safety responses.**
